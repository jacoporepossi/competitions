# AI Assistants for Data Tasks with Gemma

The goal of this competition was to create a notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma LLM to accomplish one of the following data science oriented tasks:

- Explain or teach basic data science concepts.
- Answer common questions about the Python programming language.
- Summarize Kaggle solution write-ups.
- Explain or teach concepts from Kaggle competition solution write-ups.
- Answer common questions about the Kaggle platform.

My final choice was the complex world of text summarization and my notebook can be found here on GitHub, but for a better user experience I suggest using the [Kaggle notebook I published](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jacoporepossi/text-summarization-with-gemma).
