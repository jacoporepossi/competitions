# LLM CTF @ SaTML 2024

[This team competition](https://ctf.spylab.ai/) was divided into two main phases:
- the Defense phase for submitting defenses. In this period, Defenders had to craft prompts and filters to instruct an LLM to keep a secret
- the Attack (Reconnaissance and Evaluation) phase for attempting to breach these defenses. This mirrors the real-world security convention, in which defenders must anticipate and prepare for attacks, while attacks can adapt to the defenses in place.

I couldn't spend too much time on this competition, but in less than a week I was able to craft a defense able to rank top 50% (23/44) among all defenses and breach 43% (19/44) of them.

A detailed writeup is on the way!
