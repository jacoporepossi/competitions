# LLM CTF @ SaTML 2024

[This team competition](https://ctf.spylab.ai/) was divided into two main phases:
- the Defense phase for submitting defenses. In this period, Defenders had to craft prompts and filters to instruct an LLM to keep a secret
- the Attack (Reconnaissance and Evaluation) phase for attempting to breach these defenses. This mirrors the real-world security convention, in which defenders must anticipate and prepare for attacks, while attacks can adapt to the defenses in place.

Despite spending a limited amount of time, my defense approach ranked 14th with an 85% filtering rate, and my attack strategy had a 33% success rate.

This marks my third competition focused on LLM security, check out the [full write-up](https://jacoporepossi.github.io/learningq/competitions'/data%20science/2024/06/28/satml-llm-ctf.html) for a detailed overview of my findings.
